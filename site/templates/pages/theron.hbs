<h3>Project Details</h3>
<p>Using Jekyll and Bootstrap the interface for WATH required an easy handoff to a third party team with the intentions of integrating into Angular. Bootstrap and jQuery were requested for the convenience of additional developers to understand and manage the code base.</p>

<h3>Process</h3>
<p>This project was straight forward as all page designs were created in Sketch and used for reference. Scope requirements were clear and objectives discussed through a short Q&amp;A session with Theron Studios.</p>

<p>Using Bootstrap we were tasked with designing and implementing the Boostrap framework for example purposes in order for additonal development to possess a guide. Implementation was done for the following interfaces.</p>
