  <h3>The Process</h3>
  <p>Where most see pages we see a set of systems. Systems that work together across many various locations that when combined, form a moving and functioning organism.</p>
  <p>I believe in the power of being open and transparent with my work by sharing through written, open source or video form. By sharing what we've learnede and created other can benefit and build awesome amazing things with this knowledge.</p>
  <p>Having an abundant network of connections is why I work with a variety of sources that meet the match for the project. Some describe working with different entities much like role casting. The right person is chosen to fit with the project requirements.</p>
