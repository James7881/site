			<h4>See The Big Picture</h4>
			<p>Where most see pages we see a set of systems. Systems that work together across various locations that when combined, form a moving and functioning organism. We take a step back and look at the project from a larger point of view to gain an understanding of objectives for both you and your intended audience. <a href="/contact">Get In Touch</a>.</p>

			<h4>Role Casting</h4>
			<p>Having an abundant network of connections is why we work with a variety of sources that match your needs. Some describe working with different entities much like role casting; the right person is always chosen to fit with the project requirements. Some companies hide behind indy contracts when work is produced through a collaborative effort, but when we pick the right team members you know each one by name and discuss your concerns with them directly throughout the duration of your project. <a href="/contact">Get In Touch</a>.</p>
