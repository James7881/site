  Jonno Riekwel of Polyon enthusiastically approached Gray Ghost Visuals with a vision to develop and construct a vector animation sequence involving the Polyon logo wonderfully crafted by Jord Riekwel.  Polyon requested that each polygon element animate indenpendently and in a staggered fashion in a desired sequence.

<p>Jonno Riekwel of Polyon possessed a deep and enthusiastic vision to develop and construct a vector animation sequence involving the Polyon logo crafted by my own logo creator Jord Riekwel. Polyon requested that each polygon element animate indenpendently and in a staggered fashion for it's sequence.</p>

<p><strong>Noteworthy</strong> : The project was picked up as a guest article with CSS-Tricks due to an earier demo exploring the polygon lion orignally posted ion Dribbble by Breno Bettnecourt. This demo was studying the capabilities of SVG polygons to move and be controlled independently using the GreenSock Animation Platform.</p>

    <h3>Leave No Traces</h3>
    <p>The Polyon logo was cleaned from top to bottom ensuring by hand that each polygon element meticulously lined up to itâ€™s adjacent and adjoining counterpart. Hours of work were invested to ensure each polygon rest prcisely on a pixel grid. The result is a crisp and beautiful polygon lion that helped push the boundaries of SVG and it's use on the Web.</p>

<h3>Challenges</h3>
In the initial researching phases I found CSS to be very difficult in terms of control compared to a library such as GreenSock and the one we chose for the final implementation. Since this type of library is geared towards JavaScript controlled animations keyframes can be controlled and executed independently as well as triggering points of the animations execution. The ultimate goal as the project evolved was to make each polygon element move independently and in a particular sequence that made it difficult to time properly with CSS. You can also see the reason why we needed to leave no traces since each polygon element was not orignally lined up correctly to each adjacent polygon.

Each polyon when placed within the browser seemed to have some anti-aliaising issues leaving roughly a 1px gap between each polygon element. To avoid this problem a stroke with a value of 2.5 and the color of each corresponding polygon element it was placed on helped to alleviate this issue slightly. Post artile for CSS-Tricks brought plenty of smart suggestions using SVG filters, but none have completely solved the problem.

<h3>Results</h3>

The final result is gorgeous and attractive. The cherry on top is the hidden eater egg hover animation that Polyon asked as a last minute add on.
