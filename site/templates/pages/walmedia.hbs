<p>The Faithmade Website Co. is intended to be used by churches as well as youth groups, non-profits, worship ministries, and conferences. A powerful church website builder that helps remove barriers for church volunteers and staff members.</p>

<p>Chris Wallace, partner &amp; technology director of LiftUX (DBA) of Walmedia LLC. approached Gray Ghost Visuals to create a handwritten effect using a vector pre-designed by their in-house team.</p>

<p>Working with SVG is absolutely one of the pleasures we get ot do on a daily basis but as with every SVG animation there come it's hurdles to solve.</p>

<p>SVG animations require a small bit of time to allow for organization to ensure paths, strokes are moving the right direction and as intended with intentions.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>Once the mechanics were in place and motions fine-tuned the result is beautiful and timeless plus supported on a wide range of browsers with wonderful performance.</p>
