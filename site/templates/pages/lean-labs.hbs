<h3>Brandvious</h3>
<p>Brandvious is a concept about bringing a 10x approach to deserving brands and understandign the way to get bigger is to get better. Guidelines were wisdom, timeless, sophisticated and legible are the words given via discovery sessions. It was important that the logo be typography focused while reamining simplistic, elegant, timeless and most importantly legible.</p>
<p>Research and time was spent investigating multiple typefaces that also has a history matching the goals of the project. This time spent lead to Museo, Adelle, Avenir and Gotham.</p>

<p>After mutliple feedback sessions it was decided the logo was lacking an element. An element that could be used in social media siutations such as avatars since using text alone would not be legible in those types of contexts. To remain true to the ideals of simplistic, a typographic element was used to create an abstract shape.</p>
