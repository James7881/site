<p>Murmuration Malts strives everyday to be “The Artisanal Malthouse of the Fingerlakes” with it's roots based in West Bloomfield, NY. Each batch of malt is cared for by hand to ensure the finest result is produced for beer lovers of every variety.</p>

<p>The project was challenging, rewarding and most importantly a pleasure to work on with Emily Hill and Judd Doe owners of the maltery. With an amazing client and idea in place it was only fitting to get a stellar team rounded up. </p>

<h3>Branding</h3>

  <img src="{{site.imgdir}}clients/murmuration/mm-identity.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>It was discussed in early brain-storming sessions the identity was to portray a particular set of qualities. Those qualities would include associations with words such as rustic, natural, earthy inviting and authentic while using a few constraints to guide. Our constraints were clear; logo must use the text “murmuration malts”, possess a red wing blackbird and contain 2 row barley (considered by many malters as the finest barley one can obtain). The back story for the bird I'll leave to the owners to explain when you visit their awesome estbalishment.</p>

<h3>Finding a style</h3>

</figure>

<p>Invision app was leveraged in order to gather reserach in a way that would allow for smooth communication between the team and our trusted clients. It was there we began our road to discovery on what the identity form would begin to look like, style of the work and pairing typefaces for which Gotham, Gotham Condensed and Sentinel were chosen. Logo design was to look hand drawn and so began the journey of collecting some examples of what hand-drawn would look like to the eyes.</p>

<h3>Looking Professional</h3>

<p>Business cards were designed as part of the project scope and stood upon the shoulders of previously discussed intentions. Using the vintage, hand drawn type of direction the cards were given a burlap texture to add a bit more visual appeal and earthy appeal.</p>

<h3>Project Details</h3>

<h3>Process</h3>

<figure class="figure-site">

</figure>

<p>In-vision was used to create a functional applicaiton interface to share before beginning the entire build in WordPress. This allowed each of us to understand the traversing of the site and how a user moves throughout as well as making sure actions are relevant and poignant.</p>


<h3>Noteworthy</h3>

<p>As with every project the path of learning is always lurking about and this project was no different than other. It was a huge learning experience from branding to development.</p>
